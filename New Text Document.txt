2. What is hoisting and what is the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)? Explain with examples

Hoisting means that JavaScript moves declarations to the top of their scope during the compilation phase.
But only the declarations, NOT the initializations.
example:>
console.log(a); 
var a = 10;
let and const are also hoisted but diffrently
They are hoisted without initialization, meaning they cannot be accessed before their declaration.
This leads us to the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ).
TDZ is the period between entering a scope and the actual declaration of a let or const variable.
During this time, accessing the variable results in a ReferenceError
 example:>
console.log(b); 
let b = 20;
ReferenceError (TDZ)

3. What are the main differences between == and ===? 
(==)--> It checks if it's same value.
(===)--> It checks if it's  the data type and the same value.

5. What’s the difference between type conversion and coercion? Provide examples of each

type Conversion is : This is when you intentionally convert a value from one type to another.
You do it manually using functions or operators

example:>
let str = "123";
let num = Number(str);

console.log(num);
console.log(typeof num); 

Type Coercion:This happens automatically when JavaScript converts one type into another behind the scenes, usually during operations

example:>
console.log("5" + 2);
